Getting Started
You can run this website locally without any special tools. Simply download the files and open the index.html file in your web browser.
Deployment
This is a static website, making deployment extremely simple. You can host it for free on various platforms.
1. Choose a Hosting Provider:
   * Netlify
   * Vercel
   * GitHub Pages
   * Cloudflare Pages
2. Deploy Your Site:
   * Drag and Drop: Most of these services allow you to simply drag the entire project folder (containing index.html, assets, etc.) into their web UI to deploy.
   * Git-Based Deployment: For a more robust workflow, connect your GitHub repository to the hosting provider. The service will automatically redeploy the site every time you push a change.
There are no build steps required. The root directory is the publish directory.
